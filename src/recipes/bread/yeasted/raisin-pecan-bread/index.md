title: Raisin-Pecan Bread
---

## Ingredients

- `100g` starter
- `380g` raisin-soaking tea/water
- `375g` white flour
- `75g` rye flour
- `50g` whole-wheat flour
- `100g` raisins (pre-soaked in Earl Grey)
- `11g` salt
- `3g` yeast
- `80g` pecans

## Notes
Bake for an 50 minutes at 425 (or 400?). Cover with foil after 15-20 minutes.

Recipe calls for 50/50 water/tea; I just use all the tea I have. I often add a little more pecans. Also can replace some white flour with buckwheat.
