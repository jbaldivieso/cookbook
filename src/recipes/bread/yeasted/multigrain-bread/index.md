title: Multigrain Bread
---

## Ingredients

- `100g` starter
- `295g` water (soaking liquid + hot water)
- `15g` maple syrup (or honey)
- `120g` whole-wheat flour
- `40g` rolled oats (soak first)
- `40g` rolled barley (soak first)
- `40g` rolled buckwheat groats (soak first)
- `280g` white flour
- `14g` salt
- `3g` yeast
- `15g` oats (for sprinkling on top before baking)

## Notes
Bake for an hour (takes 10 minutes longer than other yeasted ones in Ken's book) at 425. Cover with foil after 15-20 minutes.

Can mix and match with the grains. Quinoa works, too. Add them up to 120g. Soaking them in about 200g of water yields about the right amount of leftover liquid.
